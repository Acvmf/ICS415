				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				<p class="question" id="one">1. Hi, I'm {Name}.</p>
				<p class="answer" id="1">Hi! I'm Lexa. No A on the front, just Lexa. Or Lex, if you prefer. It's short for Alexandra.</p>
				<p class="question" id="two">2. So are you a student?</p>
				<p class="answer" id="2">Aha, an actual question. Yep, I'm studying Computer Science at Manoa. I'm a junior this year. I'd like to focus on security or Artificial Intelligence.</p>
				<p class="question" id="three">3. Wow, you must be crazy smart!</p>
				<p class="answer" id="3">Thanks, but I'm really not that far down the bell curve. I just love computers and pick languages up easily, so it seemed a good choice and I'm loving it so far! Computers are far more rational than humans.</p>
				<p class="question" id="four">4. So what are your plans for the future?</p>
				<p class="answer" id="4">Finish up my degree, find a job, see the world, try to decrease the total entropy in the universe.</p>
				<p class="question" id="five">5. Isn't that impossible?</p>
				<p class="answer" id="5">As far as we know, yes! But that's a truly terrifying thought, so I refuse to give up hope before I've even begun. Theoretically, decreasing the amount of entropy local to our area should be possible... I'll start with that. Energy at no cost to our galactic neighborhood seems like a decent starting point.</p>
